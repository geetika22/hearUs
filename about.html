        <p>
          “Mental health problems don’t define who you are. They are something you experience. You walk in the rain and you feel the rain, but, importantly, YOU ARE NOT THE RAIN.”
            <br>
          — Matt Haig
        </p>
        <p>“If you are broken, you do not have to stay broken.” <br> — Selena Gomez</p>
        <p>“My dark days made me stronger. Or maybe I already was strong, and they made me prove it.” <br> — Emery Lord</p>
        <p>“But no matter how much evil I see, I think it’s important for everyone to understand that there is much more light than darkness.” <br> ― Robert Uttaro</p>
